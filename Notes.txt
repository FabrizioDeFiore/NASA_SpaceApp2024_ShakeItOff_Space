Important definitions for the project 
Reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVlt0ar7vPk   Basic Geophysics: Artificial Intelligence in Seismology
- Picking = determination of phase arrival
- Seismic automatic picker routines are based on manual feature extractions
they extract specific proprietis of the trace wich are correlated to characterise different seismic phases such as amplitude 
-STA LTA 
Any values of the STA/LTA ratioo above a pre-deifned cut-off threshold are interpreted as a phase arrival
artificial neural netw
Machine Learning / Supervised Learning Process
1 Deriving netowrk architecture = defines how many layers build the neural network and how they process the data
2 Training on classified dataset = 
3 Applying on new data
CNN 
they reduce and condese the data until the most appropriate feature to characterize the (goal) are apparent
Feature map 
durin g this the value in the convolutional filter are being iterated until the error in the CNN prediction is at minimum 
when compared against the true classification of the data

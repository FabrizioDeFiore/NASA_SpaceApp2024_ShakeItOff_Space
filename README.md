# Seismic Detection around the space
**Third Place in the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024**
## Challenge
**Seismic Detection Across the Solar System** <br>
Write a computer program to analyze real data from the Apollo missions and the Mars InSight Lander to identify seismic quakes within the noise
## Project Description
>This project represents a significant advancement in lunar seismology, utilizing a neural network to effectively differentiate between lunar quakes and background noise. The model's high accuracy and innovative architecture contributed to a third-place finish in a hackathon, demonstrating its potential for groundbreaking applications in lunar exploration and research.
- Accurate Quake Detection<br>
  The neural network is highly proficient in identifying lunar quakes, even in challenging conditions with low signal-to-noise ratios. This accuracy is crucial for understanding the moon's internal structure and seismic activity.
- Revolutionary Architecture<br>
 The model's unique architecture is a key factor in its success. Its design likely incorporates advanced techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or Fully Connected layers, which are well-suited for processing time-series data such as seismic signals.
- 3D Data Visualization<br>
 The inclusion of a Unity-based 3D visualization tool provides a powerful means to explore and analyze the detected lunar quakes in a visually immersive environment. This can aid in understanding the spatial distribution of quakes, identifying potential sources, and correlating seismic events with other lunar phenomena.

- Picking = determination of phase arrival
- Seismic automatic picker routines are based on manual feature extractions
they extract specific proprietis of the trace wich are correlated to characterise different seismic phases such as amplitude 
-STA LTA 
Any values of the STA/LTA ratioo above a pre-deifned cut-off threshold are interpreted as a phase arrival

Machine Learning / Supervised Learning Process
1 Deriving netowrk architecture = defines how many layers build the neural network and how they process the data
2 Training on classified dataset = 
3 Applying on new data
CNN 
they reduce and condese the data until the most appropriate feature to characterize the (goal) are apparent
Feature map 
durin g this the value in the convolutional filter are being iterated until the error in the CNN prediction is at minimum 
when compared against the true classification of the data


The tedies part is to convert the csv or the seed file to a training dataset. 
Load csv the data column as input x, then use the arrival time as the output y.
The output should be of the same size as input. Y
You can create an 0 array that has the same length as x and set the arrival time to 1. 
Then use a CNN f to map from x to y: y = f(x). 
There is an additional challenge about training, that is, for y, you have too many 0 but just a 1. it is very unblanced. 
If you try it you will see the model prefers to output y=0 because it is a lazy but effective strategy to reduce error. 
So you may need to adjust the loss function to emphasis more on false negative. 
Then it should work.
There are another part is for the STA and LTA windows. The two parameters can be learned in the neural network.
STA and LTA window size can be viewed as the variance (no statistic meaning) of a gaussian function. 
Then the neural network needs to learn the variance. This will adapt STA and LTA with CNN
